# Professional Website
This was a project I began in 2016. I had written this with just HTML and CSS, so it was all Markup. Fast forward 3 years, and this project is now a SPA written in [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the domain is through [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
