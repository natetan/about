  "preface": "When I was younger, I would look to the stars and dream about where I'd be in the future. I thought of flying spaceships and intergalatic space travel. I dreamt of clear skies on sandy beaches, with the waves crashing gently to shore. I saw myself putting blocks together, forming a monumental sculpture raised towards the open sky. Yeah, I did none of those things.",
  "about": "I didn't always want to be a software developer. I was interesting in architecture at first. I liked the idea of building structures from small pieces and seeing projects built from the ground up. But I realized I was too lazy and sitting in front of a computer screen seemed like the better option. Plus, I'm also building things in code.",
