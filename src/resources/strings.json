  "preface": "A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, I graduated from Franklin High School in 2014, unsure of what I wanted to do. Nothing really interested me in class, or engaged me in a way that made me think, \"hey, this is something I really want to do when I grow up!\". That all changed when I attended college at the University of Washington and took my first intro programming course.",
  "about": "I fell in love with programming immediately. I loved being able to create programs that do cool things, and I loved building projects from scratch. However, I felt like I didn't know much, and the subject is vast and ever growing. Over summer of my freshman year, I took the initiative to learn more programming. I studied web development and mobile development for hours everyday and it fueled my passion even more. In that very moment, I knew I wanted a career as a Software Developer.",
